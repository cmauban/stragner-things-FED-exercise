# Stranger Things - FED Exercise

### Task
Create a website to display content about a Netflix original that is popular in our RTP-Durham office. Your audience is the casual web visitor who’s looking for something to watch on TV.

We've provided a sample layout to help you get started. Feel free to implement towards the layout or create your own.

### Guidelines
 - We anticipate this exercise will take about 4-6 hours, over the course of 2-3 days
 - Do NOT exceed 4-6 hours; we don't want to be disrespectful of your time
 - Please don't use jQuery
 - Aside from jQuery, feel free to use any tools you prefer to complete the project, including frameworks, preprocessors, or libraries

### Requirements
 - Render from the content provided in [data/en_US.json](./data/en_US.json).  NOTE: We ask that you don’t change the structure of the JSON. Feel free to render additional content from other sources if you'd like or to render statically (e.g. button labels, section headings, etc.) where you see fit.
 - Be creative and play with the UI. Again, there's no "right way" to build this.
 - Your website should:
    - be responsive
    - have a navigation
    - offer translated content -- We’ve provided you with content for a mock language (la_PG - Pig Latin). Any text you add to your page that is not coming from the provided JSON does not need to be translated.

The last detail is the most important... We want you to have fun with it!  We want to see your personality in the code, UI/UX, and the little things you do to make this simple content come to life.
